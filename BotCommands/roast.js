            "Youâ€™re living proof that even if something is broken, it can still be functional.",
            "Youâ€™re one of a kindâ€”luckily, because two of you would be too much!",
            "You're like Wi-Fi: sometimes you're just a little spotty.",
            "Iâ€™d call you sharp, but I donâ€™t want to exaggerate.",

            "Your 'on fire' moments remind me of a sparkler. Bright, but don't get too close.",
            "You're a team player... if the team is imaginary.",
            "You're like a parking spotâ€”never there when anyone actually needs you.",
            "Youâ€™re like a Google search: you come up with results no one asked for.",
            "You're like a demo version of yourselfâ€”just enough to get by, but missing key features.",
            "You're proof that being loud is not the same as being interesting.",
            "You're the human equivalent of a pop-up adâ€”surprising, unnecessary, and occasionally funny.",
            "Youâ€™re like coffeeâ€”an acquired taste, and some people just canâ€™t handle you.",
            "You're like a meme in 2025: funny for five seconds, then forgotten forever.",
            "You're great in a crisis... mostly because you're the one who caused it.",
            "Youâ€™re the kind of friend whoâ€™d watch me struggle just to narrate it hilariously.",
